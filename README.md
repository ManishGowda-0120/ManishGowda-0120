## Hi there 👋

I'm Manish Gowda, a backend developer focused on Java and the Spring ecosystem.

I enjoy understanding how things work under the hood — especially how Spring and Spring Boot manage logic, dependency injection, and application flow using clean Java code.

Right now, I’m learning and building with Java, Spring, Spring Boot, JDBC, Servlets, Security, and gradually exploring AI concepts. I prefer learning by coding, experimenting, and breaking things to understand them better.

This GitHub is where I’ll be sharing practice projects, backend experiments, and learning-based implementations as I grow into a strong backend engineer. Everything here is written with the intention of understanding the logic, not just making things work.
