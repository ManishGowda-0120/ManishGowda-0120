## Hi there 👋

• Hi, I'm Manish Gowda, a backend-focused Java developer.

• I enjoy learning how things work under the hood and building clean, logical backend systems.

• Currently, I’m learning and working with Java, Spring, Spring Boot, JDBC, Servlets, Security, and exploring AI integration in backend applications.

• I focus on understanding core concepts like IoC, dependency injection, loose coupling, database interaction, and API design by writing and breaking code.

• I mainly use Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, JDBC, Git, and basic frontend tools for testing backend flows.

• You can find my projects here on GitHub as I learn, build, and improve step by step.
